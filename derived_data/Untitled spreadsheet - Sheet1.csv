[[Brigham Young|He]] said a\nman by seeking that which did not belong to him would loose\nthat which he seemeth to have as in this case Br [[Milo Andrus|Andrews]] by \nunlawfully marrying this woman is now left without any wife\nthere is no Elder in this church [who has] any right to marry a woman to\na man who has a living wife, many men act like fools as soon as\nthey get an idea that women should obey their husbands & be passive in\ntheir hands they will go to the woods & get a bundle of sticks & com-\nmence whiping their wives to make them obey them in the first\nplace a husband should be a righteous man a man of God & rule his \nhoushold in righteousness & govern his wife with kindness & love & not\nwith a rod, club, or his fist, his conduct to his wife should be such\nthat she will love him with all of her heart and he should pray to\nGod that his wife & children which are jewels given him might be\nsaved & not taken from him that not any thing need be lost which\nthe father hath given him. He said that many men through their con-\nduct would have taken from them that which they had & given to another.\nHe said that when a man had a jewel given to him he ought to prize it &\ntreasure it up & take good care of it & in process of time other jewels\nmight be given him of the Lord, but he should not undertake to \nsteal them for he could not keep them, and a man should not\nbe in a hurry to obtain any blessing or exhaltation that is not for\nhim & when he has proved himself faithful in all things before\nGod there is no good thing that will be withheld from him in \ntime or Eternity & many other good instructions were given\n\nPresident [[Joseph Young|Joseph Young]] followed with interesting remarks\n& gave it as his opinion that Br Andrews ought to be cut off from\nthe Church for adultery, most of the quorum of the Twelve \nspoke upon the subject also the presidents of the Seventies after\nwhich it was moved & carried that Milo Andrews be cut off\nfrom the church for adultery. it was also moved and carried \nthat the woman be cut off from the Church fromor adultery. It\nwas moved & carried that they both be left in the hands of the\nPresidents of the Seventies meeting then adjurned and the\nTwelve went into the recorders office & met in council\n\n"
